Built an Iris flower classification model using Python and scikit-learn. Applied data preprocessing, EDA, and used algorithms like Logistic Regression and KNN. Evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

# Iris Flower Classification - Internship Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of my Data Science internship at **Oasis Infobyte**. The goal was to build a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using the famous **Iris dataset**.

## 🏢 About Oasis Infobyte
Oasis Infobyte is a growing tech company that provides internship opportunities for students to gain real-world experience in fields like Web Development, Data Science, Machine Learning, and more. The company focuses on skill-building and practical learning.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Classify the species of Iris flowers based on features like:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Used Pandas and Seaborn for data loading and visualization.
   - Checked for missing values and outliers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized distributions and relationships using pairplots and heatmaps.

3. **Model Building**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Trained models using:
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Decision Tree Classifier

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated accuracy using confusion matrix and classification report.
   - Compared performance of multiple models.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Outcome
Achieved high accuracy with all three models. The project demonstrates basic classification techniques in supervised machine learning and builds a strong foundation in model evaluation.

## 📁 Dataset
The Iris dataset was sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

## 🙌 Acknowledgment
Thanks to **Oasis Infobyte** for the opportunity and guidance throughout the internship.
